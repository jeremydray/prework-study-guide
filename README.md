# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is a helpful guide intended to both test and retain the information learned throughout the Prework course material, primarily HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Git. The end purpose of this is to serve as a quick reference of key points and topics learned throughout the course, but it is also as a great source of behind the scenes coding to learn from and also be able to look back at. Having everything consolidated onto this webpage makes finding notes much more easier than flipping through a notebook and scanning the pages trying to locate what was written. A lot was learned by doing this project, including the key terms and concepts from each section, coding structures/syntax differences of each, and how all of these different languages (and Git) rely and work with each other to build what this project has become.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use, open the webpage in order to view the notes of each section for HTML, CSS, Javascript, or Git. In order to view the Javascript components that list the topics and have a randomly selected topic to review, you will need to use the DevTools and view the console. To do this, press Command+Option+I (Mac) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). With this open, you should be able to refresh the page (command + R on Mac, Ctrl + R on Windows) and see the "Let's study.." line randomly choose from the four listed topics to study.
