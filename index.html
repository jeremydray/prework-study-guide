      <h2>HTML</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The "frame" of the webpage comprised of elements enclosed in brackets, primarily the &lt head &gt and &lt
          body &gt
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>The &lt head &gt element contains information about the webpage.</li>
        <ul> - Can contain nested child elements including &lt title &gt, &lt style &gt, &lt link &gt, &lt meta &gt, &lt
          base &gt, and
          &lt script &gt</ul>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>The &lt body &gt element represents the visible content show to the use.</li>

        <ul> - The body element is an example of a semantic HTML element that describes its content and role on a
          webpage (body, section, etc.). </ul>
        <ul> --- try to use when possible, as it makes code easier to read for the browser and
          other developers.</ul>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Some elements include attributes that further define what is shown or to add more information, such as
          &lt a <u>href</u> &gt; when creating links or &lt section <u>class</u> &gt when creating sections</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Can contain many nested child elements, including:</li>
        <ul> - headers: &lt h1-h6 &gt header of a section/paragraph. Use in order and only use h1 ONCE per page.</ul>
        <ul> - sections: &lt section &gt division of webpages into organized areas</ul>
        <ul> - paragraphs: &lt p &gt blocks of text or paragraph</ul>
        <ul> - unordered list & ordered lists: &lt ul &gt & &lt ol &gt used to create lists on webpage document</ul>
        <ul> - list items: &lt li &gt the individual items of a list (such as each bullet point on here!)</ul>
        <ul> - images: &lt img &gt the images/pictures used on the page</ul>
        <ul> - empty spaces between content: &lt br &gt to separate content as needed</ul>
        <ul> - anchors: &lt a &gt used to create links</ul>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Also can use a &lt footer &gt element, primarily used for information about author, copyright, contact,
          sitemap, and navigation.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>3 Ways to Style a Page</li>
        <li>- inline CSS: style an element directly in the HTML file</li>
        <li>- internal style sheet: embeds an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file</li>
        <li>- external CSS style sheet: a linked external file that holds selected CSS rules in a separate file; usually
          the
          <u>preferred</u> for "separation of concerns" coding
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>CSS rules generally have selectors (div, header, h1-h6, img) and declarations (property: value;) such as
          margin
          or padding, assigned
          with a value </li>
        <li>* selector: special wild card symbol that says all elements on the page will have style properties assigned
        </li>
        <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
        <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
        <li>Can combine two selectors if both will have same styles applied (header and footer example in code)</li>
        <li>Class Selector can be used to assign CSS styles to elements classed as same name in rule (ex. .card {width:
          80%;} will apply style attributes to all HTML elements classed as "card")</li>
        <li>Can also adjust width, height, border, box-shadow of elements in the HTML file</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="card" id="git-section">
      <h2>Git</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Git: version control system</li>
        <li>Github: cloud based hosting service to track projects and versions in repositories remotely</li>
        <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
        <h3>Create a Branch</h3>
        <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
        <ul> - git: preceding requirement for every Git statment</ul>
        <ul> - checkout: move working branch to a new branch</ul>
        <ul> - -b: flag that creates new branch</ul>
        <ul> - branch-name: name of the new branch; good practice to use prefix for what branch is intending to change
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <h3>Add Files and Commit changes:</h3>
        <li>git add -A</li>
        <ul> - add: git command to add files/changes</ul>
        <ul> - -A: flag used to for ALL changes</ul>
        <li>git commit -m "[description]": commits changes with a description of what was changed</li>
        <ul> - commit: command to commit staged content as a new commit snapshot</ul>
        <ul> - -m: flag to add a message</ul>
        <ul> - description: should be imperative and in present tense, such as "change font size"
          <ul></ul>

    <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
        <li>Three keyword options for variable declaration: </li>
        <ul>- "const": hard sets the data of the variable</ul>
        <ul>- "let": allows for the variable data to possibly change if needed</ul>
        <ul>- "var": not commonly used in modern Javascript</ul>
        <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
        <li>Conditional logic (if and if/else statements) look for a "truthy" in order to execture</li>
        <ul> - A "falsy" (0, -0, 0n, "", null, undefined, NaN, or the Boolean value "false") will cause the statement to
          skip that condition</ul>
        <li>Arrays: a single variable that contains a group of data (including numbers, strings, Boolean value, and any
          combination of those value types); Arrays are zero indexed, which means the first index count beings at "0"
        <li>"For" loops allow for code to be repeatedly run and re-run as needed; 3 statements in a "For" loop:</li>
        <ul>- Starting point for the loop (ex: let x = 0)</ul>
        <ul>- Condition: what determines if a loop keeps running (ex: x &lt shapes.length)</ul>
        <ul>- What allows the array to reiterate over each item: increasing or decreasing in order to loop over desired
          array selections (ex: x++ (shorthand to incrementally increase by 1, or x + 1))</ul>
        <li>Functions: a set of instructions that can tell the computer what to do; 2 parts:</li>
        <ul>- Define a function: use the 'function' keyword, assign a function name followed by the () (ex: 'myName ()'
          ), and the code block containing the desired instructions with the {} (ex: {console.log("Jeremy")}) </ul>
        <ul>- Call the function: running the function by using the function name (); for example, myName() after the
          function is defined (due to ßControl Flow)</ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
